interventions in this disease. This protocol outlines the strategy for a systematic review and
meta-analysis to identify, from in vivo animal and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)
studies, potential therapeutic interventions for ALS. Our aim is to perform a comprehensive
review of the ALS literature to compile a list of (1) candidate interventions and (2) target pathways that may be of therapeutic benefit in patients with ALS.

pathological mechanisms underpinning the disease and the establishment of a variety of diverse animal models of the disease. We will
therefore examine the in vivo ALS literature with a focus on identifying interventions and target pathways that may have a therapeutic
benefit in ALS.

rhythm, memory, body weight), (2) biochemical (misfolded protein
load, markers of cell stress) and (3) histological measures (integrity of
motor neurons, axons, glia, astrocytes, neuromuscular junctions and
muscle).
Study design: all study types where outcome in animals or cells
exposed to the intervention is compared with that in animals or cells
not exposed to the intervention.

We will use the Systematic Review Facility online screening tool
(app.syrf.org.uk). We will screen the title and abstract of each paper
identified and for potentially relevant papers the full text will be
retrieved, imported to EndNote and duplicate records will be discarded. Two independent reviewers will assess each paper (for
screening and data extraction) with regards to the inclusion and
exclusion criteria and a quality score and will extract data as
described below. If reviewer concordance is <0.66 a third reviewer
will assess the paper.

4 | METHODS
Sources: databases: (1) PubMed, (2) Medline and (3) EMBASE
NB: there will be no publication date restrictions and no language
restrictions.
Date of searches: April 8, 2016.

4.5 | Eligibility
4.5.1 | Inclusion criteria
• All therapeutic interventions where outcome is compared with
that in a control or placebo group in ALS or FTD disease models.

• Types of model.
• Genetic (knock out/in) OR drug induced (not combinations).

• Natural death or euthanased or N/A.
• Outcome: (1) outcome measure (2) primary or secondary (3) value.

4.5.2 | Exclusion criteria
• No control group.

• Co-treatments.
• Combinations of genetic and pharmacological induction of
phenotype.
• Cancer cell lines and all non-human iPSC lines.

4.7 | Statistical analysis
An individual meta-analysis will be carried out for each intervention
identified and a subgroup analysis of interventions grouped by putative biological target will also be performed. Additional subgroup analyses will include (1) assessment of SOD1 G93A mouse model
control-group survival data for evidence of genetic drift with time
and (2) comparison of efficacy of treatments and targets separately in
sporadic and familial models of disease.
The outcome measures will be plotted for each of the studies identified and included on a forest plot. Given the variability of model organisms included in the analysis, primary outcome data (survival summary
data) will be calculated as described previously4 and secondary outcome
